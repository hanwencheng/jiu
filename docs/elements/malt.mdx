# Malt

## EBC

The easiest way to calculate EBC is use `EBC-total/Weight-total`
EBC-total: accumulation of weight of malt multiplied by its BEC,
Weight-total : the total weight of the malt used in mashing.( Sch√ºttung )

## Types

* Caramel Malt: increase the body and stability of foam, add sweetness. Rarely should the total caramel malt exceed 10% of the grain bill, and 5% is probably a better target. more types see [here](http://beersmith.com/blog/2014/06/26/caramel-and-crystal-malt-in-beer-brewing/)
