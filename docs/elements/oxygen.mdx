# Oxygen

## In yeast reproduction

oxygen -> synthesis sterols and UFA(unsaturated fatty acids)-> lipid membranes ->  new yest [1]

Too much oxygen is rarely a problem, but yeast do not need too much oxygen, it does not reslt in excess sterols. Instead, the yeast use the oxygen 
for making more flavor compounds

oxygen for average wort and yeast pitching rate is 8 to 10 ppm (parts per million)

Excessive usage of pure oxygen results in high levels of fuse alcohols, increased acetaldehyde, and other flavor problems
