# Oxygen

## In yeast reproduction

oxygen -> synthesis sterols and UFA(unsaturated fatty acids)-> lipid membranes ->  new yest [1]

Too much oxygen is rarely a problem, but yeast do not need too much oxygen, it does not reslt in excess sterols. Instead, the yeast use the oxygen 
for making more flavor compounds

oxygen for average wort and yeast pitching rate is 8 to 10 ppm (parts per million)

Excessive usage of pure oxygen results in high levels of fuse alcohols, increased acetaldehyde, and other flavor problems.

Increasing the oxygen level pass 9 ppm increase the pace of fermentation slightly but it ended up at the same terminal gravity.

### High Gravity Beer
If the gravity of a beer is more than 1.092( 22 &deg;P), it is a must to aerate with pure oxygen,
 as air will not provide a high enough level of dissolved oxygen. and that might not be enough,
 beer need adding a extra dose of exygen for 12 - 18 hours for help fermentation speed and attenuation.
 why 12 hours is because we need wait for the yeast to complete at least first cell division.
