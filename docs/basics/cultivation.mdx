# Yeast Cultivation

## Make a starter

Purpose
* Lower the incidence of off-flavors from bacterial or wild yeast contamination.
* "Cleaner" flavor and aroma with lower level of ester and phenols.
* Primary fermentation starts faster and finish sooner.
* Beer will finish dry and crisp with less chance of sickly-sweet finish
from under attenuation.

## Affected Elements

##### Time
 12-24 hours
 Storing the yeast in the same vesssel for an additional 8 - 12 hours after they reach terminal 
 gravity allows them to build up their glycogen(糖原) reserves. 
 Separating the spent wort from the yeast too early selectively discard the less flocculent, 
 higher-attenuating individuals in the yeast population.
 
 It is better to keep the starter closer to fermentation temperatures from the beginning(around 3&deg;C to 6&deg;C)

##### Temperature
21&deg;C to 24&deg;C
Warmer starter equals more rapid yeast growth, but there are limits. 
Very rapid growth or excessive growth may result in weaker cell membranes due to lower
UDA concentrations. But too cold result in slower and often less growth.

##### Oxygen
Better with stir plate and stir bar
The stir plate may also [affect the yeast growth calculation and inoculation rate](http://braukaiser.com/blog/blog/2012/11/03/estimating-yeast-growth/)
Yeast will be far more healthier with small continuous source of oxygen throughout the process.

##### Gravity 
1.030 - 1.040 
easy calculation is to use 10 to 1 ratio DME to water
for example: 100 DME for 1000 ml Water
too low a gravity result in minimal growth, but easier on the yeast
too high gravity give stress to yeast, but in more growth

#### Yield Factor
Yield factor = ( millions / ml ) cell final - ( millions / ml ) cells initial / Gravity decrease &deg;p

## Process

* measure the water.
* add the dry malt extract
* add 1/8 teaspoon yeast nutrient, (amino acid and zinc, nitrogen) rasin or dead yeast as alternative, [check the question](https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/22920/any-food-alternatives-you-can-use-to-brewers-yeast-nutrient)
* boiling for 15 minutes 
* pour the wort in to flask with a funnel
* cover the flask with alu foil
* move the flask into cold water in order to chill it, be careful not to make the flask float.
* sanitizer the scissors, stopper, foam, and stir bar
* add the yeast and stir bar, better with clamp to pick the stir bar
* chill the flask for several hours so that the yeast will remains in bottom
* decant the wort and pitch the yeast (if the size of started is more than 5 percent of the beer volume)
* 2-Step incubation is that to add the boiled wort now into the flask 
* repeat the previous steps


## Caution

### Using stir plat
1. Stir plate will generate heat to push the starter into a temperature range that is detrimental to the yeast.
	A small one will add 3&deg;C to the ambient temperature.
2. Stir plate's action of drawing air into the liquid can cause the temperature of the starter to mirror
 changes in the temperature of the surrounding air.
 
### Nutrient
Key nutrient for yeast propagation is oxygen, amino acid, zinc and nitrogen. 
Use all-malt wort for starters, the sugar in the stater needs to be maltose, not simple sugar.
Yeast grown exclusively on simple sugars stop making the enzyme that enables them to consume maltose, but brewing wort is mainly maltose.
The pH of a starter needs to be around 5, only if you have high pH water source, you need to consider it.


### White Labs packaging yeast.
sanitizing the top of the vial to keep the dust from dropping into starter.
also shake the vial to loosen the yeast inside, let it rest a few minutes, and slowly open the top to prevent the excessive foaming.
