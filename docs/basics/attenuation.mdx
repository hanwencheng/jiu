# Attenuation

Attenuation is a measure of how complete the yeast fermented at wort, 
and it is usually expressed in a percentage.

## Calculation

````
[(FG - OG) / ( OG - 1 )] * 100
````

* OG: Original Gravity
* FG: Final Gravity

## In Practice

should daily check the gravity. Checking attenuation is a simple step to make consistent, high-quality
beer.

Normally from 65 to 85 percent. A real attenuation of 100 percent is rare, because wort contains a complex mixture of carbohydrates,
with many of them being unfermentable.

Wort contains five fermentable sugars: glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose and maltotriose. 
Maltose > maltotriose > glucose
Yeast cannot ferment dextrins, and yeast strains differ in their ability to ferment maltotriose.

A well fermented beer have complex carbohydrates result in a higher finishing gravity, and they
do not taste sweet. But other factor like presence of various alcohols and other flavor compounds.

Generally, a higher start gravity beer result to a higher end gravity beer.
