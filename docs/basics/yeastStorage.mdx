# Yeast Storage And Maintenance

Most brewers agree that the best place to store yeast is under beer. But two crucial factors are temperature and time.

* The ideal storage temperatures range is between 33-38oF.  Cold temperatures will also help retard bacterial growth.
* As yeast sits in storage, they consume their glycogen reserves.  Glycogen deprivation weakens their cell walls and makes them more susceptible to rupture. Cold temperatures retard this process.

Test yeast before use:
The best thing to do for yeast after it has been stored for two weeks â€“ if it tests clean -- is to add some fresh wort before using.  This helps to restore yeast strength and ensures a successful fermentation.  Simply pour off beer that has separated from flocculated yeast, add fresh wort at 9-12 Plato, and let it sit at room temperature for 10-20 hours. Assuming yeast activity was evident in this "starter" or "activator", pitch into fresh wort as usual.
