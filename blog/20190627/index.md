# Second batch

## Malt

base malt: 
* Pale ale malt 6800g - 2137g + 489g
* Chinese Pilsner malt 720g

* Caramel Red Malt 720g
* Aroma Malt 140g
* Chocolate Malt 140g

## Hops

Two fermentor, fast fermentor 11 Liter we call f1, carboy we call f2.

f1 start actively after 8 hour, while the f2 start actively after 11 hours.

* Firstly the bubble choke at f1, then everything is ok, even through there are lots of foams at the head space.
* Probably because f2 has less head space, the foams are really strong, they even get out of the fermentor. Then I have to do the top cropping.

With less flocculent yeast, better with top cropping.
